# Matrix Multiplication using OpenMP
## Parallel Computing Assignment

### 1. Program Description
This program implements both sequential and parallel matrix multiplication using OpenMP. It compares the performance between these two approaches and demonstrates the speedup achieved through parallelization.

### 2. Source Code
```cpp
// Matrix multiplication implementation using OpenMP
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <omp.h>
// ...existing code...
```

### 3. Implementation Details
- **Sequential Multiplication**: Traditional three-loop matrix multiplication
- **Parallel Multiplication**: OpenMP parallel implementation using #pragma omp parallel for
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures execution time and calculates speedup
- **Verification**: Compares results between sequential and parallel versions

### 4. Sample Output
```
Enter matrix dimensions (m n p) for A[m×n] * B[n×p]: 4 4 4
Enter number of threads to use (0 for auto): 4

Matrix A (4x4):
  45  23  12  89
  67  38  91  34
  12  78  56  43
  44  32  76  21

Matrix B (4x4):
  34  56  78  12
  90  23  45  67
  11  22  33  44
  55  66  77  88

Results:
Matrix dimensions: 4x4 * 4x4
Actual threads used: 4
Sequential time: 52 μs
Parallel time: 18 μs
Speedup factor: 2.89x
Results match: Yes
```

### 5. Performance Analysis
